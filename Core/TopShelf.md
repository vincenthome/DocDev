#Topshelf

A Windows service framework for the .NET platform. 
Topshelf makes it easy to create a Windows service, test the service, debug the service, and ultimately install it into the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM). 

When a developer uses Topshelf, creating a Windows service is as easy as creating a console application. Once the console application is created, the developer creates a single service class that has public Start and Stop methods. With a few lines of configuration using Topshelfâ€™s configuration API, the developer has a complete Windows service that can be debugged using the debugger (yes, F5 debugging support for services) and installed using the Topshelf command-line support.
