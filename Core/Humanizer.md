# Humanizer

Humanizer is a library for .NET which allows you to display all manner of data in a “human friendly” fashion. The list of what it can do is way too long for this email, but here are a few highlights:

 - [Convert DateTime to a more friendly “in 7 days from now”, or “5 seconds ago”](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer#humanize-datetime)
 - [TimeSpan](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer#humanize-timespan) e.g. 2 milliseconds, 1 day, 2 weeks
 - [ToQuantity](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer#toquantity), [Pluralize](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer#pluralize) or [singularize](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer#singularize) strings
 - Convert strings to [PascalCase](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer#pascalize), camelCase, Title Case, etc
 - Convert [numbers to words](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer#number-to-words) "one hundred and twenty-two"
 - [Humanize DisplayName or Display attribute](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer#mix-this-into-your-framework-to-simplify-your-life)
 - [Truncate String](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer#truncate-string) - fixed length, fixed # of chars, fixed # of words
